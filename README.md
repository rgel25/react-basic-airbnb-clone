## Welcome! üëã

This is a very basic form/clone of Airbnb's experience web page. The goal of this project is to apply proper usage of component props when you have a standalone data. In this case, I used a JSON like data for 3 different Airbnb experiences.

## The challenge

The main challenge here is to display three technically different cards using the same component.

## My solution

To solve the challenge, I used Array Mapping to render three instances of the Card component while passing each array element as props.
